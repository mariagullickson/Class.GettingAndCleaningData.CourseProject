# merge the training and test sets to create one data set


# extract only the measurements on the mean & standard deviation for each
# measurement


# use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set


# appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names


# create a second, independent, tidy data set with the average of each
# variable for each activity and each subject
